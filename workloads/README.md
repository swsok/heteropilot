# workloads

Request workloads consumed by `python -m serving --dataset <...>` and by
`python -m bench run --dataset <...>`. Static `.jsonl` files live at the
top level; the `generators/` subpackage produces fresh ones on demand
and the `examples/` folder ships ready-to-edit invocation templates.

```

## Format

Datasets are stored as `.jsonl` files (one JSON object per line). Two formats are supported:

### Flat requests (e.g., ShareGPT)

Each line is an independent request:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input_toks` | Integer | Number of input (prompt) tokens |
| `output_toks` | Integer | Number of output (generated) tokens |
| `arrival_time_ns` | Integer | Request arrival time in nanoseconds |
| `input_tok_ids` | List[Integer] | (optional) Token IDs of the input sequence for prefix cache matching |
| `output_tok_ids` | List[Integer] | (optional) Token IDs of the output sequence |

```json
{"input_toks": 128, "output_toks": 512, "arrival_time_ns": 0, "input_tok_ids": [1, 2, 3]}
```

### Agentic sessions (e.g., SWE-bench)

Each line is a session with chained LLM calls. The simulator respects dependency chains:
each sub-request is submitted only after the previous one completes plus the tool duration.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session_id` | String | Unique session identifier |
| `arrival_time_ns` | Integer | Session start time in nanoseconds |
| `sub_requests` | List[Object] | Ordered chain of LLM calls |

Each sub-request has:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input_toks` | Integer | Number of input tokens for this LLM call |
| `output_toks` | Integer | Number of output tokens for this LLM call |
| `tool_duration_ns` | Integer | Time to wait after this call completes before the next can start (0 for last) |
| `input_tok_ids` | List[Integer] | (optional) Token IDs for prefix cache matching |
| `output_tok_ids` | List[Integer] | (optional) Token IDs of the output |

```json
{
  "session_id": "task-0-run0",
  "arrival_time_ns": 4059740,
  "sub_requests": [
    {"input_toks": 1472, "output_toks": 133, "tool_duration_ns": 127348767},
    {"input_toks": 1582, "output_toks": 125, "tool_duration_ns": 0}
  ]
}
```

Both formats can coexist in the same file. Format is auto-detected by the presence
of the `sub_requests` key.

## Provided datasets

### ShareGPT traces

Generated on demand by `python -m workloads.generators sharegpt --model <hf-id>
--num-reqs <n> --sps <r>` (see `generators/`). Output files land directly in
this directory and follow the flat-request format above with `input_tok_ids`
populated for prefix-cache hashing.


### SWE-bench agentic traces
Agentic sessions derived from real SWE-bench coding tasks with LLM calls chained
by tool calls (bash, grep, file edits). Each session is a complete coding task
consisting of multiple LLM sub-requests (6--20 per session) interleaved with tool
executions.

| File | Sessions | Sub-reqs | Avg sub-reqs/sess | Rate (sess/s) | Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `swe-bench-qwen3-30b-a3b-50-sps0.2.jsonl` | 50 | 765 | 15.3 | 0.2 | Qwen3-30B-A3B |

### Fixed-length probes (NPU execution-model spike)

Built by truncating and concatenating ShareGPT token ids so that **every request
has the same input length**, which is what makes them probes rather than
workloads: a batch of them keeps every sequence inside one of the vendor
artifact's attention buckets for the whole run. Nothing is sampled, so they are
not traffic and must not be used to characterise performance -- they exist to
isolate one variable. `WORK_ORDER_npu_exec_model_spike.md` STEP C.1 and C.3.

Prefixes are deliberately distinct between requests (90+ distinct 16-token
prefixes in each), so the prefix cache stays out of the measurement; the runs
confirm it at 0.0--0.1 % hit rate.

| File | Input | Output | Requests | KV range | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `fixedlen-512in-128out-64.jsonl` | 512 | 128 | 64 | [512, 640] | C.1: one decode bucket, tells the `composed` selection rule apart from batch-size matching |
| `bucket1024-900in-100out-96.jsonl` | 900 | 100 | 96 | [900, 1000] | C.3: every sequence on the 1024 attention rung |
| `bucket2048-1900in-100out-96.jsonl` | 1900 | 100 | 96 | [1900, 2000] | C.3: the same at 2048, for the length dependence |

### Other
| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `example_trace.jsonl` | Small example trace for quick testing |

## Generating workloads

Workloads are produced via the `generators/` subpackage, which uses the
target model's tokenizer to populate `input_tok_ids` (so prefix-cache
hashes are stable) and Poisson-distributed arrivals at the requested
rate. The default source dataset is `shibing624/sharegpt_gpt4` (HF
hub); pass `--source` to override with another HF id or a local file.

The simplest path is to copy one of the templates under `examples/`,
edit the model / sps / num-reqs as needed, and run it from inside the
vLLM Docker (`scripts/docker-vllm.sh`):

```bash
./workloads/examples/gen-qwen3-32b.sh
# or override the model on the command line:
MODEL="my-org/my-model" ./workloads/examples/gen-qwen3-32b.sh
```

For ad-hoc invocations:

```bash
python -m workloads.generators sharegpt \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-32B \
    --num-reqs 300 --sps 10 --seed 42 \
    --output workloads/sharegpt-qwen3-32b-300-sps10.jsonl \
    --use-vllm --vllm-tp 2 --vllm-dtype bfloat16
```

`--use-vllm` drives a real vLLM `LLM` engine in offline batched mode to
fill `output_tok_ids` with the model's natural responses (free
generation). Without it, `output_tok_ids` come straight from the
ShareGPT assistant turn.

To create a workload manually, write JSON objects to a `.jsonl` file
following the format above and pass the file path via `--dataset` to
`python -m serving` or `python -m bench run`.
